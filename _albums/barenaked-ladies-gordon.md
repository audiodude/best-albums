*Gordon* was a favorite record of my youth, and it really is easy to see why. The songs are lighthearted, peppy and sometimes outright comical in the case of “If I Had \$1000000”. Though this clearly isn’t serious or pretentious fare, there is a definite love of melody shown by these Canadian pop rockers. This is an album that you can sing along with front to back.
