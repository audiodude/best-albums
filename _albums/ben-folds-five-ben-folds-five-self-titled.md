There is a raw energy to the songs on Ben Folds Fiveâ€™s debut self titled album that may, at first listen, mask some of the clever pop rock craftsmanship lying under the surface. Folds delivers catchy tunes that are surprisingly complex, showing off the versatility of his ironically named three piece. A truly amazing album.
