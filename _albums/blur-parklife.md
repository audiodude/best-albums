If I were a respectable music journalist, you would be reading about a second British invasion. Or maybe a third one, I'm not sure. What you're reading about instead is catchy modern pop rock that isn't too heavy and isn't too electronic. This album strikes the right combinations of new and classic, pop and rock, over and over (like clover in Dover).
