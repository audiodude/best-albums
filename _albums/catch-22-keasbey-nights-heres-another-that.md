Here's another that doesn't quite have popular appeal. This album, however, is a masterpiece of so-called "third wave" ska, also known as punk ska. The songwriting and arrangements are tight, and there is so much raw energy in every song on here. This is considered a classic amongst listeners in the genre, and is also one of the best albums in the universe.
