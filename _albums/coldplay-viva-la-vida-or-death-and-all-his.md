I’m going to lose some street cred with this pick, but I don’t care. Coldplay is obviously one of the most popular acts of the so-called “oughties” and this album is a gem. It sounds unlike other pop rock albums, without getting too experimental or abstract. ”Violet Hill” is the first song I heard off here, and the guitar solo in the middle is a definite rocker. Great construction throughout, an album that is just a joy to listen to.
