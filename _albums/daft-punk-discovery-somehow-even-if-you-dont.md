Somehow, even if you don't consider yourself a fan of electronic music, Daft Punk’s *Discovery* just seems to grab you. Many will recognize “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger”, which was sampled for Kanye West’s 2007 single “Stronger”, and which itself sampled an earlier song called “Cola Bottle Baby”. Equally good is “Aerodynamic”, which was once the most played track in my iTunes library. And none of this takes into account [the animated music video/film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstella_5555:_The_5tory_of_the_5ecret_5tar_5ystem) that uses the album in its entirety as the soundtrack. Premium stuff!
