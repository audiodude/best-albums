When a classmate on my freshman floor found out that I liked punk/ska, he gave met this record. I instantly fell in love. This is danceable, singable punk rock that isn't quite as vapid as a “pop punk” label might suggest. The "witless banter" gets old around the third playthrough, but otherwise this is one of the best albums in the universe.
