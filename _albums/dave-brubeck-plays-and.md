I was given this album by my mother at a young age, and gradually fell in love with it. The key is its spontaneity: Brubeck famously recorded the songs in his home with little or no rehearsal. The result is not sloppy, per se, but would better be described as relaxed. You get an amazing glimpse at a true craftsman when listening to this album.
