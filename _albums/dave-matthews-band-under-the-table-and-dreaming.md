Dave Matthews Band was seen by many as a kind of teeny-bopper fad, or in some cases the soundtrack to the stoned summer breaks of too many college kids. Their major label debut, however, is catchy, unique (they famously feature violin and wind instruments prominently in their arrangements), and even has a bit of emotional depth.
