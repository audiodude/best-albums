*Narrow Stairs* is a dark, moody but surprisingly melodic collection of somewhat subdued modern rock songs. The extended version of “I Will Possess Your Heart” really strikes a groove while songs like “Cath” stand out as different yet familiar. This is a great collection and every song is a winner (except maybe for the end credits being read aloud).
