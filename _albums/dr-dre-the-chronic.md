Although maybe best known as the debut of Snoop Dogg, _The Chronic_ contains a number of great tracks and stands up as one of the best albums in the universe in its own right. No, I don't like skits on rap albums, and this one has plenty. But let's be honest, this is an album that basically helped define a musical genre and a movement (gangsta rap).
