This album is probably best described as modern rock with punk elements. There are upbeat crunchy guitars throughout, and the somewhat similar sounding hits “I Will Buy You A New Life” and “Father of Mine” add some radio cred. Some might bemoan the very polished sound, certainly not a DIY record, but honestly this is a rocker from start to finish.
