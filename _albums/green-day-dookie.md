Another no-brainer pick from 90s Alternative Rock radio. The wide airplay and continuing popular appeal of this album should not detract from its status as among the best in the universe. Straight ahead punk rock, reborn for the 90s, Green Day would define the sound of a generation of Pop Punk artists, without all that much pop-influence themselves. Catchy, immediate and energetic.
