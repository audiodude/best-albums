This album is not a third wave ska album. It would better be described as “punk rock with horns”. But oh, so much energy. *Borders and Boundaries* is relentless, singable fun. The track “Gainseville Rock City” is a stand out perfection of the sound and form of this album, but every number on here is a keeper. One of the best albums in the universe, hands down.
