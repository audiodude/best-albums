Another pop punk album, but one that's masterfully crafted. Though I don't think Gabe Saporta is going to win a Nobel Prize for his writing here, it definitely gets the job done and works extremely well with the musical content. There are punk cliches here, sure, but they are employed powerfully and without hesitation. On *Save The World Lose The Girl*, Midtown takes the "same four chords" and makes one of the best albums in the universe.
