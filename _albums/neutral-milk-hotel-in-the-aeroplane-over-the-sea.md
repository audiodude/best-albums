Sitting somewhere between folk and indie rock, _In the Aeroplane Over the Sea_ is a darling for many. The melodies are as catchy as the lyrics are abstract, but the energy and mood of the album is what really pushes it forward, from one somewhat lo-fi track to the next. A truly great album that defines and captures a particular sound very well.
