Nirvana's final studio album, *In Utero* is noisy and incoherent at times, yet surprisingly catchy at others. These two aesthetics combine masterfully to create a single creation that fulfills one of the higher goals of one of the best albums in the universe: taking the listener on a journey from start to finish. After such a sonic journey, the radio-friendly *All Apologies* brings the album to a satisfying close.
