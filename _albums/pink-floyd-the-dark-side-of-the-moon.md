This is one of those albums that probably speaks for itself, but let's make a case anyway. _The Dark Side of the Moon_ is a bluesy psychadelic album which smartly addresses themes of life and death, conflict, greed and many others. The album works together, start to finish, as a fantastic whole. It is a brilliant masterpiece of modern music.
