Besides the raw punk rock energy on Rancid's third album is the fact that the songs are just _good_. The arrangements are tight, the melodies are singable, the guitar parts are varied, and the lyrics are passable if not brilliant. This is an album that is clearly meant to be enjoyed at full volume. It's one of the best in its genre and one of the best in the universe overall.
