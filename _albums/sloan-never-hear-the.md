Many have pointed out the correlation between the name of this album and the fact that it contains 30 tracks. However, Canadian indie rockers Sloan delight the listener from start to finish. The lively songs on the album walk the line between indie and pop rock, with singable hooks and appreciable guitar solos. This is one that you can listen to over and over again and never get fatigued.
