It's hard to talk about this album without buying into the idea that Billy Corgan was overreaching a bit. Although it's a great album, our own knowledge of the band's ambitions on this one seem to underscore our response. In reality, this is two hours of fantastic alternative, heavy metal, and something-in-between music. There is a diversity of sound and depth of emotion here that can't be ignored.
