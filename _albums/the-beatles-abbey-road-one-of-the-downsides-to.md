One of the downsides to the age the iPod, perhaps is the end of the art of the album. (Although, some say that came with the death of records). No album, perhaps is more convincing to this generation, then the last 16 minutes of Abbey Road (sometimes referred to as the golden slumbers medley). This album — although somewhat a cliché choice — was the inspiration for my name, and hence the first album I chose.
