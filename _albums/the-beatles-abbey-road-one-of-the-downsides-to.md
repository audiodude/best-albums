One of the downsides to the age the iPod, perhaps is the end of the art
of the album. (Although, some say that came with the death of records).
No album, perhaps is more convincing to this generation, then the last
16 minutes of Abbey Road (sometimes referred to as the golden slumbers
medley). This album — although somewhat a cliché choice — was the
inspiration for my name, and hence the first album I chose.
