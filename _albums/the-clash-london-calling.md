The Clash move past punk for *London Calling* and come up with an album that is accessible, inventive and just plain rocks. Of course, the international hit title track is here, but there's also catchy tunes such as *Clampdown*, a personal favorite. This is an instant classic from the first listen, and is undeniably one of the best albums in the universe.
