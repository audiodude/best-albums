The Postal Service was a one off collaboration between Death Cab for
Cutieâ€™s Benjamin Gibbard and producer Jimmy Tamborello. The group was
named after the method of collaboration: the two literally sent each
other tapes to dub over in the mail. The result was an album that is
electronic but not dance, with a refreshingly modern sound. The second
half of the record gets bogged down in electronic explorations, but the
upfront material is above and beyond good.
