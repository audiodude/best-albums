The Postal Service was a one off collaboration between Death Cab for Cutie's Benjamin Gibbard and producer Jimmy Tamborello. The group was named after the method of collaboration: the two literally sent each other tapes to dub over in the mail. The result was an album that is electronic but not dance, with a refreshingly modern sound. The second half of the record gets bogged down in electronic explorations, but the upfront material is above and beyond good.
