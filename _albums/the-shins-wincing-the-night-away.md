A somewhat subdued indie rock album, this lesser known selection from The Shins has enough hooks to drive it forward, while at the same time having no lack of inventiveness and creativity. Several years later, this album still sounds fresh and new, and frankly unlike most things out there, without getting bogged down in an 'experimental' label.
