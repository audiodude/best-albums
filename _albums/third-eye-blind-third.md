Many albums on this list are deliciously eclectic, mixing styles and pioneering a certain sound. Third Eye Blind's debut album is notable for how well it stays grounded in a particular late 90's post-grunge style that ushers in a return of pop rock. Don't be fooled though, this one rocks and is catchy as hell. Truly one of the best.
