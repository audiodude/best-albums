Those over 35 might not realize the impact of Weezerâ€™s debut album on an entire generation of modern rock listeners. The sound is crunchy but not quite punk, not quite grunge. Tracks such as*Buddy Holly* and *Undone (The Sweater Song)* are surefire classics that still get radio airplay today. This is one of those choices that almost seems too easy.
