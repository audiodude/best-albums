In fact, if you aren&#8217;t a fan of punk music you might overlook this amazing album. Even if you only have a passing interest in punk, this is the genre at its distilled finest and is definitely worth checking out.</p>"},{"slug":"weezer-weezer-the-blue-album-those-over-35","timestamp":1332862440,"photo_url_lg":"http://36.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1jvaawKb91rsqbe7o1_400.jpg","photo_url_sm":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1jvaawKb91rsqbe7o1_100.jpg","artist":"Weezer","link":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000003TAW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=besalbintheun-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000003TAW","album":"Weezer (The Blue Album)","spotify_id":"5n15QbYKbO4pzAV2Iy1VVG","html":"<p>Those over 35 might not realize the impact of Weezer&#8217;s debut album on an entire generation of modern rock listeners. The sound is crunchy but not quite punk, not quite grunge. Tracks such as<em>Buddy Holly</em> and <em>Undone (The Sweater Song)</em> are surefire classics that still get radio airplay today. This is one of those choices that almost seems too easy.</p>"},{"slug":"the-beatles-abbey-road-one-of-the-downsides-to","timestamp":1332549420,"photo_url_lg":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1d5qhoQZa1rsqbe7o1_400.jpg","photo_url_sm":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1d5qhoQZa1rsqbe7o1_100.jpg","artist":"The Beatles","link":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025KVLUQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=besalbintheun-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0025KVLUQ","album":"Abbey Road","html":"<p>One of the downsides to the age the iPod, perhaps is the end of the art of the album. (Although, some say that came with the death of records). No album, perhaps is more convincing to this generation, then the last 16 minutes of Abbey Road (sometimes referred to as the golden slumbers medley). This album — although somewhat a cliché choice — was the inspiration for my name, and hence the first album I chose.</p>"},{"slug":"belle-and-sebastian-the-life-pursuit-this-album","timestamp":1332445500,"photo_url_lg":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1axj5Fjul1rsqbe7o1_400.jpg","photo_url_sm":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1axj5Fjul1rsqbe7o1_100.jpg","artist":"Belle and Sebastian","link":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S570AA/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=besalbintheun-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000S570AA","album":"The Life Pursuit","spotify_id":"1hS6jLMAAtF4UDOucCewKR","html":"<p>This album just makes me feel good.
